# Schedule_Optimization_Child_Care_Institution
Generates a schedule of 28 days consisting of 2 shifts (A, B) and 12 employees. Regulatory requirements ("Successive days"), managament demands ("minusplus", "forbidden") and employee satisfaction (Viol_Pattern_Emp) were considered. Violation of soft constraints were penalized in the objective function. Quadratic terms were used in the objective function to achieve a more stable distribution across shifts and employees.
